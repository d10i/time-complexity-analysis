\section{Future work}
TODO:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Multi-thread support
  \item Measuring algorithm auto-calibration?
  \item Get Big-O complexity
  \item Automatically exclude functions that are too small?
  \item Different time recorder implementations, maybe using network
  \item Allow specifying what fitting functions to exclude (e.g. I know no functions have exponential behaviours)
\end{itemize}
